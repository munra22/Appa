        <p><img src="Appa.jpg" alt="This is me!" style="float:right;height: 240px; width:240px">Hello world!  My name is Appa, and I am very excited to get to tell you a little about me and my life.  I was adopted by my humans three years ago and they think I am about 7 years old.  I have two adopted brothers, Sherlock and Watson, who look an aweful lot like cats, but that's OK because they are still awesome.  I am a <em><bold>Pitbull</bold></em> and this scares some people but I don't know why, I love everyone and am really a super fun freind to have.

        <p>  A lot of people don't know that there are a lot of kinds of Pitbulls.  With four major groups being American Stafforshire Terrier, American Pit Bull Terrier, Stafforshire Bull Terrier (My favorite), American Bull Dog, and Bull Terrior.  And to make matters more complicated there are a lot of sub-breedas of each of these! To find out more jump over to the <a href="Pitbulls.htm" title="My people!!">Pitbulls</a> section or for some outside reading you can always go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_bull" title="www.wikipedia.com/Pit_Bulls"target="_blank">HERE</a> </p>
