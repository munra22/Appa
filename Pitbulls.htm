            <h4>Sad truth</h4>
            <p>Yes some pitbulls have been responsible for biting and attacking people but these are events relating to special circumstances.  Lots of dogs bit people for many different reasons, and it is never the breed of dog that causes it.  Treating a dog with love and respect raises a dog that loves and respects people.</p></aside>
