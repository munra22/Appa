        <h2>Why should you adopt a dog from the pound?</h2>
        <p class="abs">There are a lot of good reasons to rescue a dog from the pound, including just being a good person.  Most of the animals at the pound were abandoned and are afraid and alone.  These are not bad dogs, these are just lonely ones.  Each one has been given a full health checkup, all their shots and boosters, and been spayed or neutered already. These guys deserve some love!</p>

        <p>The cost for adoption can be very expensive and problematic. Also many people tend to want to buy pure breed dogs which are prone to health issues and can be very costly month to month.  If it is the cost of getting a new pet just go with the adoption, it really is the best choice in the situation.</p>
