        <h2>BALL!</h2>
        <p class="ball"> </p>
        <h2>Walks!</h2>
        <p>Oh boy do I love walks!  We go walking every single day, but my favotire walk in the whole world is when my humans take me down to the peir and I get to walk by the ocean.  </p>
        <h2 id="Watson">Watson</h2><img src="Watson%20evil.jpg" title="No really this dude is evil" style="height:360px;width360px">
        <p>This guy is my little brother, and he is also the greatest source of pure evil the world has ever known.  I love him and we like to play but I am being very serious here, this little dude is the devil and will devour your soul and drain all happiness from your life.  You look upon Watson, the destroyer of worlds.  Isn't he great!!!</p>

        <h2 id="Sherlock">Sherlock</h2><img src="Sherlock%20again.jpg" title="Sherlock is my buddy!" style=";height: 360px; width:600px">
        <p>This is my brother, my best freind, and my favorite thing of all things.  Sherlock is almost as old as I am but we are opposites in almost every way.  He likes to sleep in and be lazy while I like to get up early and run all day.  He likes to take naps in the day, while I like to poke him with my nose and see if he wants to play.  But we are the best team you could ever imagine and of all the things in this world, he is my favorite.</p>
